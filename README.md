# DIY-Carbon-Aluminium-Active-Pedals

This is my carbon fiber and aluminium set, for a DIY Active Pedals.

Here you'll find instructions and other information to use it and buy it.

The alu set is based on the amazing DIY project of [tjfenwick](https://github.com/tjfenwick/DIY-Sim-Racing-Active-Pedal), and [ChrGri](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal). 

I discovered it some weeks ago and after after making my first working piece, I was so exiting in doing it in a full Carbon Fiber and Aluminium version. 
I have re-designed all parts, and ask to one of my trusted supplier about the opportunity to produce all this parts in Aluminium.

Since the minimun production pieces was of 10 complete set, I had the idea to create a purchasing group to reach this quantity.
The idea was very successful and we reached 16 interested users in 5 days, and already launched the first production batch (1st production started on 12 december)

### [December 13th, 2024] We are thinking in opening a new production batch to reach again a minimum of 10 complete sets.

If you are interested in partecipate to the Purchasing group, please join the dedicated Discord channel here [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zTfQaxpAUz) and look for this project in the Offerings (Marketplace) [Direct Discussion link](https://discord.com/channels/1113129142142120159/1314604509863084103) or visit [this page](https://github.com/Simdesign-Race/DIY-Carbon-Aluminium-Active-Pedals/wiki/Interested-Users) and write there your contact info

As soon as we reach 10 interested users, I will ask you to pay for your set, and the order to the supplier will start. It takes about 18/20 days to produce and shipping.

The Carbon and Aluminium Set comes already assembled and Ready to use with a Totally assembled Carbon fiber Pedal
