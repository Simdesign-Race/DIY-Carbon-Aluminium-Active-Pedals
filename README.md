Here you'll find instructions and other information to use it.

The alu set is based on the amazing DIY project of https://github.com/tjfenwick/DIY-Sim-Racing-Active-Pedal , and https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal. 
I discovered it some weeks ago, and I was exiting in doing it in a full Carbon Fiber and Aluminium version. 
I have re-designed all parts and ask to one of my trusted supplier about the opportunity to produce all this parts in Aluminium.
Since the minimun production pieces was of 10 complete set, I had the idea to create a purchasing group to reach this quantity.
The idea was very successful and we reached 16 interested users and already launched the first production batch.

We are thinking of opening a new production batch which will once again have to be a minimum of 10 complete sets
